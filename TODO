slist ----------
add support for raw slists.

what is considered a raw slist?

A raw slist does not perform any kind of 'list (as a container)' management.
This means that the first node acts like the head of the list,
and the push, pop, append, remove, find operations don't rely on any
kind of information that is usually stored in as slist.

This set of 'raw' functions for slist operations, should be able
to manipulate an slist->head, however this would evidentially require for
the user to manually manage the slist in order to maintain the behavior of
slist common functions.

NOTE: consider implementing in one of the following ways:
1) less likely {
   add macro flags, which simply strip slist operations
}

2) likely {
   add raw slist structure and a union structure, making raw functions
   take the union and let them find which structure was passed.
}

3) likely (more then 2) {
   refactor slist to add a raw slist , this would then allow for
   raw functions be able to safely cast slist into a raw slist and
   perform their operations.
}

4) more likely (
   add raw slist structure and make raw functions take an
   argument which acts like a flag, that determines which type
   of node was passed, and then act acordingly
}
