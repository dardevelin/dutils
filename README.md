FAQ:

Why later option is not available in the license ?
Because at the time of this writing no other versions exists, and thus
I can't be sure I agree with them. Contact me if you have any license needs.

Why yet another common data structures library.
I needed one, so I wrote one which is according to my taste,
both in design and license.
